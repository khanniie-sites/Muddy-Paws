# Assignment 5 PUI 2020

## Link to site

Note: khanniie.github.io is set up with react router, which somehow broke gh-pages on this account, so while the main code will be hosted using my khanniie account, I'm deploying the site on a different github account called khanniie-sites instead.

## Extra credit

I made 5 extra pages.

1. Dog Harness product page
2. Cat backpack product page
3. GPS collar product page
4. Food attachment product page
5. Water attachment product page

## Citations

I'm using Prettier to format my code with consistency.
