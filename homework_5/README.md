# Assignment 5 PUI 2020

## All source code is in the /public file.

## [Link to site](https://connie.dog/PUI_2020/homework_5/public/)

Note: khanniie.github.io is set up with react router, which somehow broke gh-pages on this account, so while the main code will be hosted using my khanniie account, I'm deploying the site on a different github account called khanniie-sites instead.

## 3 main pages

1. [homepage](https://connie.dog/PUI_2020/homework_5/public/)
2. [product browsing page](https://connie.dog/PUI_2020/homework_5/public/browse/)
3. [cat harness page](https://connie.dog/PUI_2020/homework_5/public/products/cat-harness/)

I'm using Prettier to format my code with consistency (that's what the package.json file is for).
